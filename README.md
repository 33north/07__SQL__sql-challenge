This is a research project on the employees of Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s to 1990s.

An ERD (entity relationship diagram) was made based on the csv files and their relationship to one another.

The list of csv files that were imported into a sql database:
  - departments.csv
  - dept_emp.csv
  - dept_manager.csv
  - employees.csv
  - salaries.csv
  - titles.csv

Data analysis was completed on the database by joining various tables together to final relevant information.

# BONUS
Suspecting that the data may be fake, the database was imported to python/pandas in order to generate visuals on the data.

Created the following visuals:
  - histogram of most common salary ranges for employees
  - bar graph of average salary by title
